# emojish

This is basically a tiny passthrough to your shell to run commands, except everything you type is shown to you as an emoji.

![A recording of emojish running. First "ls" is typed in, but it displays as "🍋🐍". The contents of this directory are shown in the output.  Then 'echo "hello"' is typed, but displayed as '🍳🌵🏠🍊 "🏠🍊🍋🍋🍊"'. "house" is shown in the output. Finally 'echo "hi"' is typed, but displayed as '🍳🌵🏠🍊 "🏠🍦"'. "hi" is displayed in the output.](./emojish.gif)
